# Utility script to stress the driver by creating and deleting the volumes. It
# runs by default 100 runs, each run it creates and deletes 10(5 xfs and 5 ext)
# volumes of each 4GB size. Hence, it requires approximately 40 GB of PMEM memory
# 
# The main intention of this script is to determine the default resource requirements
# to be set for the driver deployed via the operator.
# This is expected to run by setting up the metrics-server and VirtualPodAutoscaler
# describe in the 'Performance and resource measurements' section in the
# developer documentation(DEPLOYMENT.md).
